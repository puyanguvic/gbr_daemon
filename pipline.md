### **Enhanced OSPF Development and Debugging Pipeline**

## **1. Project Initialization and Setup**
- **Project Structure**: Define and create the necessary project directories (`src`, `include`, `lib`, `tests`, etc.) according to a planned architecture.
- **Version Control**: Initialize a Git repository with meaningful commit messages to track all code changes effectively.
- **Build System Configuration**: Write a detailed `Makefile` to define compilation rules, dependencies, build targets, and conditional flags for different build types (debug, release).

---

## **2. Development of Core Libraries (`lib/`)**
These foundational libraries support the entire OSPF daemon and must be implemented thoroughly and independently tested.

### **2.6 Network Operations (`network.c` & `network.h`)**
- **Goal**: Abstract network socket creation, binding, and multicast operations.
- **Implementation Steps**:
  - Implement socket operations (RAW sockets for OSPF, address binding, multicast join/leave).
  - Test network communication using simulated network interfaces.

### **2.7 Kernel Routing Interaction (`kernel_route.c` & `kernel_route.h`)**
- **Goal**: Manage kernel routing table updates using `libnl` for efficient route additions and deletions.
- **Implementation Steps**:
  - Define functions to interact with the kernel routing table, with appropriate permissions.
  - Test on a controlled environment to ensure routes are correctly added, deleted, and modified.

---

## **3. OSPF Data Structures and Definitions**
- **Header Definitions**: Fully define the `ospf_t` structure and other core data types within `ospf.h`.
- **Protocol Constants and Enums**: Define packet types, OSPF states, timers, and other necessary constants to match RFC 2328 specifications.

---

## **4. OSPF Core Module Development**
Implement the OSPF protocol step-by-step, with isolated testing for each module before integration.

### **4.1 Packet Handling (`ospf_packet.c` & `ospf_packet.h`)**
- **Goal**: Parse and create OSPF packets based on type and contents.
- **Implementation Steps**:
  - Implement header parsing and packet type-specific processing (Hello, LSA, Acknowledgments).
  - Write tests to validate parsing correctness with various OSPF packet scenarios.

### **4.2 Interface Management (`ospf_interface.c` & `ospf_interface.h`)**
- **Goal**: Manage OSPF interfaces, including their states and associated network characteristics.
- **Implementation Steps**:
  - Use platform-specific network interface APIs to retrieve configuration and state.
  - Test interface discovery and OSPF-specific configurations like MTU size and IP assignments.

### **4.3 Neighbor Discovery and Management (`ospf_neighbor.c` & `ospf_neighbor.h`)**
- **Goal**: Implement OSPF neighbor discovery, state machines, and event handling.
- **Implementation Steps**:
  - Handle Hello packet reception and neighbor state transitions (DOWN, INIT, TWO-WAY, etc.).
  - Test neighbor adjacency establishment, teardown, and state machine progression.

### **4.4 LSA Handling (`ospf_lsa.c` & `ospf_lsa.h`)**
- **Goal**: Manage Link State Advertisements, including creation, aging, and database storage.
- **Implementation Steps**:
  - Implement LSA serialization/deserialization and integrity checks (sequence number, aging).
  - Validate correct LSA handling in isolation before integrating with flooding and SPF.

### **4.5 Flooding Mechanism (`ospf_flood.c` & `ospf_flood.h`)**
- **Goal**: Implement the flooding mechanism for LSAs across OSPF networks.
- **Implementation Steps**:
  - Implement reliable LSA flooding with acknowledgment handling and retransmission.
  - Test by simulating networks to verify consistent LSA dissemination across topologies.

### **4.6 SPF Calculation (`ospf_spf.c` & `ospf_spf.h`)**
- **Goal**: Implement the Dijkstra-based Shortest Path First algorithm for route calculation.
- **Implementation Steps**:
  - Use the LSA database to construct a network topology and compute the shortest path tree.
  - Test SPF calculations under varying network changes (link state changes, topology adjustments).

### **4.7 Routing Table Update (`ospf_route.c` & `ospf_route.h`)**
- **Goal**: Apply SPF results to update kernel routing tables.
- **Implementation Steps**:
  - Synchronize the OSPF routing table with the kernel's FIB, handling updates and deletions.
  - Validate by comparing kernel route entries to OSPF-calculated routes.

## **5. Full Integration and Main Program (`ospf_main.c`)**
- **Combine Modules**: Integrate all OSPF modules and test initialization, startup sequence, and event loops.

## **6. Configuration Parsing**
- **Functionality**: Read configuration parameters for OSPF from a user-defined file format.

## **7. Testing and Debugging**
- **Unit Testing**: Validate each module separately using the `tests/` directory with rigorous and varied test cases.
- **Integration Testing**: Deploy a multi-router test environment using VMs, containers, or network namespaces.
- **Packet Capture**: Use tools like Wireshark to analyze OSPF packet exchanges.
- **Verbose Logging & Debugging**: Set logging to `DEBUG` and use `gdb` for stepping through complex interactions.

## **8. Performance Optimization**
- **Profiling**: Identify bottlenecks using profilers (e.g., `gprof`) and optimize key pathways.
- **Resource Management**: Verify no memory leaks (using tools like `Valgrind`), and confirm optimal use of CPU and network resources.

---

## **9. Documentation and Code Quality**
- **Documentation**: Update `README.md` for detailed build, configuration, and usage instructions. Ensure code is well-commented, and write developer documentation for complex modules.
- **Code Review & Style**: Ensure consistent code style and conduct peer code reviews for best practices and error detection.

## **10. Final Testing and Deployment**
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Run full-stack tests in realistic environments to confirm robustness.
- **Containerization**: Use Docker for easy deployment and testing across multiple environments.
- **Automated CI/CD**: Integrate CI/CD pipelines to automate building, testing, and deploying the OSPF daemon.

## **Debugging and Best Practices**
- **Iterative Testing**: Test each module immediately after implementation to catch bugs early.
- **Robust Logging**: Use extensive logs for state changes, packet exchanges, and errors.
- **Fault Simulation**: Test resilience by simulating network failures and unexpected scenarios.
- **Memory & Resource Checking**: Regularly check for resource leaks and optimize usage.
